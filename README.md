🎯 Implement the useState hook to manage gallery state (e.g. selected image). - determining which image we are looking at

🎯 Return JSX from multiple components (e.g., an ImageItem component for each image and a Gallery component to display them).
✔️ Nav, ImageToolbar, ImageModal, GalleryViewImage, PENDING: SearchBar

🎯 Use the .map() function to render an array of images dynamically - map through them show them in toolbar
✔️ Images from the API are shown in the toolbar

🎯 Implement functionality to display a larger version of an image when its thumbnail is clicked. - on click to make modal

🎯 Ensure all images have meaningful alt text. - alt text is there!
✔️ The alt text is already in the API, I have used it for all images

🎯 Ensure basic keyboard navigation for image selection (e.g., thumbnails should be focusable and activatable with Enter/Space). - remember the last version of this
